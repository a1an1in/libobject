The ZIP archives are created by the PkZIP/PkUnZIP combo produced
by the PkWare company. The PkZIP programs have with LHArc and ARJ
the best compression.
The directory information is stored at the end of the archive, each local
file in the archive begins with the following header; This header can be used
to identify a ZIP file as such :
OFFSET              Count TYPE   Description
0000h                   4 char   ID='PK',03,04
0004h                   1 word   Version needed to extract archive
0006h                   1 word   General purpose bit field (bit mapped)
									  0 - file is encrypted
									  1 - 8K/4K sliding dictionary used
									  2 - 3/2 Shannon-Fano trees were used
									3-4 - unused
								   5-15 - used internally by ZIP
								 Note:  Bits 1 and 2 are undefined if the
										compression method is other than
										type 6 (Imploding).
0008h                   1 word   Compression method (see table 0010)
000Ah                   1 dword  Original DOS file date/time (see table 0009)
000Eh                   1 dword  32-bit CRC of file (inverse??)
0012h                   1 dword  Compressed file size
0016h                   1 dword  Uncompressed file size
001Ah                   1 word   Length of filename
								 ="LEN"
001Ch                   1 word   Length of extra field
								 ="XLN"
001Eh               "LEN" char   path/filename
001Eh               "XLN" char   extra field
+"LEN"
After all the files, there comes the central directory structure.
(Table 0010)
PkZip compression types
0 - Stored / No compression
1 - Shrunk / LZW, 8K buffer, 9-13 bits with partial clearing
2 - Reduced-1 / Probalistic compression, lower 7 bits
3 - Reduced-2 / Probalistic compression, lower 6 bits
4 - Reduced-3 / Probalistic compression, lower 5 bits
5 - Reduced-4 / Probalistic compression, lower 4 bits
6 - Imploded / 2/3 Shanno-Fano trees, 4K/8K sliding dictionary

--- Central directory structure
The CDS is at the end of the archive and contains additional information
about the files stored within the archive.
