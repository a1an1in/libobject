# Core Module

The core module provides the foundation for object-oriented programming in C. It includes features such as:

- **Inheritance**: Enables code reuse by allowing one object to inherit properties and methods from another.
- **Polymorphism**: Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class.
- **Encapsulation**: Protects object data by restricting access to internal details.

### Examples

```c
#include "core.h"

int main() {
    // Example usage of the core module
    return 0;
}
